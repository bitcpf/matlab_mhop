% To validate the problem of multiband mesh network




%%Input file format: 
% GPS time, Board Time, RX velocity, TX Velocity, RX Latitude, RX
% Longitude, TX latitude, TX longtitude, 4 RSSI(2.4,5.2,450,900), 4 Tpt, 4
% Delay, 4 Activity Level
% 

% Input data should be named as vncdata;

% Output data is tpt accuracy and delay accuracy
% Each metric has 5 value, means input 1 band RSSI for 4 bands, then input
% all four band rssi
