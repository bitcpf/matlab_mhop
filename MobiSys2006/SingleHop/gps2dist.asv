%GPS2DIST.M
%This function takes in two GPS coordinates in the form that is output from
%Dr. Knightly's handheld GPS receiver, and it outputs the distance between
%the two points in meters. NOTE: this function can accept vectors of points

function dist = gps2dist(N1,W1,N2,W2)

Ndiff = N1 - N2;
Wdiff = W1 - W2;

gpsdist = sqrt(Ndiff.^2 + Wdiff.^2);
