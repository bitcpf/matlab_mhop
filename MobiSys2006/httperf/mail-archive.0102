Very new to httperf - I have a number of very basic questions:

1.  Is httperf available for Windows platform?

2.  Need to test various combinations of httperf simulating browsers sending 
requests to a secure web site (SSLv3).  Is it possible to simulate 
individual SSL connections?  Similarly, simultaneous connections.

3.  Can httperf be used to simulate x number of sessions/connections, so 
that memory leaks can be identified.

4.  Measure the number of pages that can be sent/received in a reasonable 
time.

Is there a httperf newsgroup that I can look at to see what other people 
have asked?

Many thanks

Kay McGinn

I can answer some of your questions.

httperf does not run on Windows.  It does run
on Linux, which will run on the same hardware
as Windows...

it is possible to do both.

it can be used to simulate either.

it does collect a variety of statistics on connections established,
requests issued, responses received,  sessions generated, etc.  These
should provide the information you need.

I don't know the answer to this one.

Kay,

Martin answered most of your questions already, so I'll handle the
remaining one:

No, this mailing list is it for now.  I do have an archive of all
previous mails to the list.  If there is interest, I should be able to
make them available via ftp fairly easily.  I realize that a web
interface probably would be better, but I'm afraid that the corporate
rules for putting up web pages would make this a less-than-trivial
project, so ftp would be the most expedient solution.

Hi David,

I for one would love to have a copy of the archive. I am starting to use httperf extensively and could use all the help I can get!. Also, does anyone have a statically linked Solaris 2.7/2.8 binary -
I'll be damned if I can get it to compile, but see that others have managed it.


Thanks


Jason Lee
