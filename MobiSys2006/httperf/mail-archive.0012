I want to simulate 100 concurrent users. I therefore need not to have
persistent connections on.  I would also like to be able to control the
number of connections simulated at any one time.
I have been using:
httperf --server cypher --port 8080 --uri /jontest.html --num-conns
50000 rate 1200 --hog
and though this seems close, it does not really do it.  I would also like
to be able to control the speed of each or all clients so I could simulate
a dsl,14.4,28.8,t1 user.
Any help would be very much apreciated.

Thanks,
Paonia

Simulating users does not require persistent connections.  However, it
does mean that you'll probably want to use one of the session-oriented
workload generators.  In httperf-speak, a "session" is roughly
equivalent to a user.  See the description of options --wsess and/or
--wsesslog in the manpage for more details.

With the workload generators currently implemented in httperf, there
are no provisions to directly limit the bandwidth of each user.
However, you should be able to get close by using suitable parameters
for --wsess or using a suitable session file for --wsesslog.

I actualy do not want persistent connection
I will look at this stuff again and see if I can figure it out this time.

I am using the httperf tool for measuring the performance of my web server. 
The problem is i dont have any manual for httperf. Can anybody guide me how 
to measure the performance parameters like throughput in terms of total 
requests that succeed for a known response size, mean response time and the 
number of hits the server can handle etc.
Any help would be very much apreciated.

thanx in advance

Rohit

Ok, I am back at it. Here is what I used:
httperf --server switch --port 80 --uri /jontest.html --wsess=500,100,0
--burst-len 100 --hog 

I was not sure if this was doing persistent connections.  I need to not
be doing persistent connections.

What I want to do here is simulate a large number of seperate users each
doing one hit and going away. I would like to be able to control the max
number of users who are trying to connect, but if I can't that is fine. I
think the above might be close but it looks like it is only doing 4 users
getting one url each. Because of --max-connections being fixed at 4.

Any help would be very much apreciated.
Thanks,
Paonia
